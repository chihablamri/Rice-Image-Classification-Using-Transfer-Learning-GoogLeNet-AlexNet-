# Rice-Image-Classification-Using-Transfer-Learning-GoogLeNet-AlexNet-
This project demonstrates rice image classification using deep learning and transfer learning in MATLAB. It compares the performance of different neural network architectures (GoogLeNet, AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19) and training techniques (SGDM, ADAM, RMSprop) on a rice image dataset.
